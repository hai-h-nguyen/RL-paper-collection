Multi-Modal Imitation Learning in Partially Observable Environments
### General:
Learn policies from expert demonstration without reward signal. Consider multi-expert learning with 2-D environment with expert
trajectories consists of two human-distinguishable behaviors. Also test with continuous control locomotion tasks. Combine the 
advantage of InfoGAIL and RNN-nased belief state representation. 

### Key points
- Existing RL methods (BC, IRL, GAIL) are restricted to learning from single-expert demonstrations for a single task under full
observability. In reality, expert demonstrations are from several experts with different levels of expertises, expertise in 
different tasks, or different presences even at the same situation. They extend InfoGAIL to pomdp settings with RNN-based belief
state representation. They joinly learn the belief state rep with the policy and critic modules. 
- A general technique in pomdb relies on RNN which embeds the history trajectory (as a hidden state b_{t-1}. Combining the current
observation z_t, action a_t and pre
