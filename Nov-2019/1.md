The paper deal with a novel task: moving a collection of unknown number of homogeneous objects into a desired area on a table top.
They used a Baxter robot. The core contribution is to learn a representation that can capture multi-object information. They used 
GNN to include relational info between each objects. They also use attention mechanism from NLP. The loss they contructed is 
also worth mentioned. Because all the objects are similar, they used the loss of correctly predict the area with high probability 
of objects instead of spitting out numerical coordinates of objects. It makes sense because these objects are the same thefore
it would be difficult to know which is the specific object that corresponds to the predicted coordinates. The loss also includes 
dynamic loss (forward and inverse kinematic loss), however in their experimental results, these lossess make no significant difference
in learning the task. They used SAC to train the agent after learning the representation. In order to transfer the learned policy to 
the real robot, they use domain randomization. They also use HER to assist learning with sparse rewards. They follow the asymmetric actor
critic approach. They feed the representation in images to the actor while the representations learned using true coordinates of objects
(taken from simulators) to calculate the goal and to feed the value network.
