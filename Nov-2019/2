I did not go deep into the paper. However, the general idea is learn how to give a curriculum so that the student (an agent
learning to walk over obstacles) can master as many task as possible (depending on the capability of the agent as well).
They used the absolute delta between performance of the agent on tasks to decide which tasks will be included next. They used
GMM to sample tasks. Tasks here meaning that the same task walking but with different parameters of obstacles (such as heights, 
shape, or distance between obstacles).
